## Fundamental Aspects of Python 

For convenience, this tutorial is provided as both a Python notebook (.ipynb) and in HTML. The HTML version of the tutorial shows output for executed code in the notebook. You can view the HTML version in your web browser. 

For the remainder of the semester, you will only find the Python notebook version included in the week's repo, although you can generate the HTML or PDF version of a notebook in JupyterLab for your personal review. 

1. Launch JupyterLab
2. Use the file browser to navigate to your local repo copy
3. Open the tutorial file: 02_Tutorial.ipynb
4. Read information in Markdown cells and run code examples in Code cells
5. Repeat as necessary

## Instructor-led Lab

1. In JupyterLab, open the instructor-led lab file: 02_Instructor_Lab.ipynb
2. Modify the file name to include your last name
  * 02_Instructor_Lab_*YourLastNameHere*.ipynb
3. Review the instructions provided in the Markdown cell
4. Complete the tasks required for this lab
5. Routinely save your notebook to ensure that you do not lose your work
6. Double check that output for your code cells is saved in your notebook
7. Push your notebook to GitHub
8. In Canvas, submit the GitHub URL for your lab on the assignment page
  * e.g., github.com/small0live/week2labs/02_Instructor_Lab_Newton.ipynb

## Independent Lab

1. Review the instructions for this lab provided in the [Independent_Lab.md](/Independent_Lab.md) file
2. In JupyterLab, create a new Python notebook
  * Python 3 (ipykernal)
3. Name your notebook according to naming convention specified in Canvas
  * 02_Independent_Lab_*YourLastNameHere*.ipynb
4. Complete the tasks required for this lab
5. Routinely save your notebook to ensure that you do not lose your work
6. Double check that output for your code cells is saved in your notebook
7. Push your notebook to GitHub
8. In Canvas, submit the GitHub URL for your lab on the assignment page
  * e.g., github.com/small0live/week2labs/02_Independent_Lab_Newton.ipynb


Make sure to shut down your instance of JupyterLab when you have finished work on your notebooks!
