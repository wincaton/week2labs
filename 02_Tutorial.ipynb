    "# Week 2 Tutorial: Fundamental Aspects of Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary goal in this module is to cover some fundamental aspects of Python. Specifically, you will learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Syntax and coding conventions\n",
    "* Variables and data types\n",
    "* Inputs and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "There is A LOT of information in this document. Please review it carefully. You may need to review it more than once before you are ready to begin this week's labs. Do not be discouraged if it doesn't all immediately make sense to you—you will get there with time and continued practice. &#x1F642;\n",

    "## Python is an Interpreted Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In a compiled language, you generally need to write all of your code before transforming it into an executable program using specific commands. Only after this compilation can you run your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, interpreted languages compile code as you execute it. This allows for a more straightforward, line-by-line development process, making it easier to understand what’s happening in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*JupyterLab* is an interactive development environment that allows you to execute a line of code, or several lines of code, at a time through a shell (interpreter or console).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Cell Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that there are several cell options available in Python notebooks: Markdown, Code, Raw. This text is written within a Markdown cell. Markdown cells do not contain executable code. Instead, they contain formatted text for descriptions, elaboration, rationale, and other important information regarding the contents of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Okay, now let's get to syntax.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages have their own nuanced way of writing code. Syntax refers to the rules that govern the structure and organization of the language. The Python programming language generally has easy-to-understand syntax (it's all relative); it favors simplicity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in Canvas, writing high quality code is important. One way to improve the quality of your code is through the adoption of coding conventions. For Python, the [PEP 8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is recommended. The goal of a style guide for a programming language is to improve the readability of code, creating consistency within your projects and across all Python projects. Although coding conventions are distinct from syntax, I encourage you to adopt them early in your use of Python to improve your code quality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "While some languages do not require indentation, it is an essential aspect of writing code in Python. Indentation refers to the whitespace preceding a line of code. Whitespace can be created using spaces or tabs. In Python, we use indentation to define code blocks. Other languages make use of braces `{}` to define code blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example in the code cell below. Toward the bottom, there is an if-statement that compares the variables $x$ and $y$, and returns some text in the case that it is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Run the example code in the code cell directly below* (tip: shift+enter, shift+return, or right pointing arrow in toolbar). You'll see that this code produces an error: an indentation error! This is because Python expects indentation after the if-statement. Without it, the code errors out."

    "#### Simplicity vs. Clarity\n",
    "\n",
    "While advantageous for writing simple code, this syntax can lead to errors for first-time users of Python. The advantage of a code block encapsulated within braces is that there is a clear delineation of the start and end of a statement. Everything contained within the braces is obvious. In Python, the code may not be so obvious. What may be included in the if-statement may seem unclear. However, with continued exposure to Python code and practice writing Python code, you will be able to identify the start and end of statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, Python differs from some other programming languages: it does not necessitate the use of parentheses for conditions in if-statements. In the above example, the conditional expression is $x > y$. The if-statement checks *if* that condition is `True` or `False` based on the pre-defined value of $x$ and $y$. Rather than use parantheses to enclose the condition, we use a colon `:` to denote the end of the expression,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if x > y:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blank Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Blank lines are ignored in Python. There is nothing to execute and they do not mean anything. Instead, blank lines are for the benefit of humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Blank lines allow us to visually segment lines of code which in turn makes them easier to read. You may also choose to add inline comments within code cells by using the hash `#` symbol before the comment text. \n",
    "* You can create multi-line commments using three double quotation marks `\"\"\"` at the beginning and end of the text to be commented out. However, if you are writing Python code in a notebook and have a multi-line comment explaining you code, it's best to put it in a Markdown cell adjeacent to the code.\n",
    "* When developing new Python code, you often try out different approaches, work through broken code, and hold onto code snippets for future use. Comments can be used in code cells to block out a section of code and prevent it from being run. However, you should routinely clean up your notebook and remove dead code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let's take the code from our example above and add some empty lines and single line comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Run the example code in the code cell directly below.* With the addition of these empty lines and inline comments, we can see a clear delineation between variables $x$ and $y$ and the if-statement. "
